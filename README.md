Are you ready to get more out of the JSF APIs? JavaServer Faces (JSF) is a Java specification for building component-based user interfaces for web applications. Top level classes for the JavaServer(TM) Faces API. The JSF APIs are convenient pluggable mechanisms to manage the execution of an application based on JavaServer Faces. You will start by learning about different aspects of the JSF API such as listeners, handlers, renderers, and factories, which can be used to get started with AJAX. 
You will begin your journey by working with action listeners, and then explore the different types of handler. You will then see why JSF needs renderers. You will then work with default and custom factories with the help of practical examples. 
In this course you will also see how JSF and HTML5 can work together for better results. Finally, you will see how to upload files in JSF
